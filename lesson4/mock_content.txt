# The Best Coffee Machines of 2025

## Introduction

Home espresso saw another growth spurt in 2025 as more people looked for café‑level drinks without the queue. Tech‑forward features such as alt‑milk steam profiles and app‑based brew scheduling are becoming standard, while sustainability options (low‑energy modes, recyclable pods) are now key buying criteria.([TechRadar][1]) Below are the five machines that out‑performed dozens of competitors in expert tests and real‑world tasting.

## Product Reviews

### 1. Breville Barista Touch Impress — *Best Overall Espresso Machine*

**Quick specs**

* **Type:** Bean‑to‑cup semi‑automatic
* **Grinder:** 54 mm steel conical burrs
* **Heating:** ThermoJet system (≈ 3 s to extraction)
* **Milk:** Auto‑MilQ wand with dairy + alt‑milk presets
* **MSRP:** \$1,499

Breville’s flagship pairs a lightning‑fast ThermoJet heater with an upgraded burr grinder and a sleek touchscreen that walks beginners through dose‑tamp‑brew steps. Its Auto‑MilQ algorithm senses dairy‑versus‑plant milk and tweaks steam pressure for silky micro‑foam every time. In hands‑on tests the Touch Impress delivered repeatable 25‑second shots at 93  °C and café‑quality lattes in under two minutes.([Coffeeness][2], [Coffee Kev][3])

*Why we love it:* barista‑grade results and the most intuitive workflow on the market.

### 2. De’Longhi La Specialista Maestro — *Best Semi‑Automatic for Milk Lovers*

**Quick specs**

* **Type:** Semi‑auto with built‑in grinder
* **Heating:** Active Thermoblock (≤ 30 s)
* **Steam:** Commercial‑style wand for micro‑foam & latte art
* **Extras:** Cold‑brew and Americano programs
* **MSRP:** \$1,199

The Maestro upgrades De’Longhi’s burr set to eight grind steps and adds a punchy 15‑bar pump that keeps crema thick even on light roasts. Reviewers praise its wand for producing café‑grade latte art and its cold‑brew mode for summer drinks, though they warn the sizable chassis demands counter depth and daily wipe‑downs.([Coffeeness][4], [YouTube][5])

*Why we love it:* hands‑on control plus pro‑level milk texture for cappuccino addicts.

### 3. Jura E8 (2025) — *Best Super‑Automatic*

**Quick specs**

* **Type:** One‑touch super‑automatic
* **Grinder:** Aroma G3 steel burr
* **Drink presets:** 17, including flat white & cold foam
* **Maintenance:** One‑button cleaning + auto‑descale
* **MSRP:** \$2,399

The refreshed E8 adds a faster, quieter Aroma G3 grinder and tighter pulse‑extraction logic, yielding sweeter espresso and consistent crema. Owners rave about its “walk‑away” convenience: press a button and get a flat white with fine micro‑foam in under two minutes, followed by a self‑clean cycle that keeps the brew group spotless.([Coffeeness][6], [Coffeeness][7])

*Why we love it:* truly hands‑free speciality coffee with barista consistency.

### 4. Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV Select — *Best Drip Coffee Maker*

**Quick specs**

* **Capacity:** 1.25 L (10 cups)
* **Brew temperature:** 92 – 96 °C via copper coil
* **Brew time:** 4‑6 min full pot
* **Warranty:** 5 years
* **MSRP:** \$359

Hand‑built in the Netherlands, the KBGV Select sticks to Specialty Coffee Association brew‑temp targets with a copper heating coil and switches automatically between half‑ and full‑pot flow rates to prevent over‑extraction. Long‑term testers report decade‑plus durability; the only caveat is that its narrow showerhead can channel on too‑fine grinds.([Coffeeness][8])

*Why we love it:* simple, fast, repairable—and it brews a pot that rivals your favourite pour‑over.

---

### 5. Keurig K‑Supreme Plus SMART — *Best Smart Single‑Serve*

**Quick specs**

* **Brew sizes:** 4 – 12 oz
* **Water tank:** 78 oz removable
* **Connectivity:** Wi‑Fi with BrewID™ capsule recognition
* **Temp/Strength steps:** 5 each
* **MSRP:** \$229

BrewID™ reads each pod’s lid and auto‑sets temperature, flow rate, and bloom time for that roast. Through the app you can start a cup from bed, schedule brews, and get maintenance alerts. Taste lags behind fresh‑ground espresso, yet for speed and ease the K‑Supreme Plus SMART remains unmatched in the single‑serve realm.([Men's Health][9], [Keurig][10])

*Why we love it:* maximum convenience plus genuinely helpful app integration.
